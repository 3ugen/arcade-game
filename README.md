# Arcade Game Project

This project is part of Udacity's Front End Nanodegree Program.

## Game description:

The player must reach water and avoid being hit by passing bugs.

## The game's rating logic:

+ Each time the player will collide with a bug the player position will be reset and new bug speed and position will be generated at random.

## Code dependencies:

+ The collision detection logic was adapted form [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/2D_collision_detection)

## To run the game locally:

1. Download and unzip [this file](https://github.com/3ugen/arcade-game/archive/master.zip).
