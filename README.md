# Arcade Game Project

This project is part of Udacity's Front End Nanodegree Program.

## Game description:

The player must reach water and avoid being hit by passing bugs.

## The game's rating logic:

+ Each time the player will collide with a bug the player position will be reset and new bug speed and position will be generated at random.
  
## Code dependencies

+ The collision detection logic was adapted form [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/2D_collision_detection)

## TO-DO

[//]: # (## Table of Contents)

[//]: # (## Instructions)

[//]: # (The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.)

[//]: # (To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality)

[//]: # (For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom * https://classroom.udacity.com/me.)


Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
